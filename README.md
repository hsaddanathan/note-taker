# note-taker


## Summary
In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a server that would serve up a note taking app. First, we were provided starting code in the form of an `index.html`,`db.json`,`notes.html`, `index.js`, and `style.css` file. Then we had to create a server using node.js and express. 

When a user navigates to the app and clicks to the "Get Started" button, they will be navigated to the notes screen. From there, the user can see previously saved notes on the left hand side, and on the right hand side they will see input fields for `title` and `text`. Once the user clicks the `save` icon on the navbar, the note will save populate on the right hand side. The user can also delete the note by clicking the `trash` icon.

## Instruction

Navigate to the following Github repository:
    https://github.com/hsaddanathan/note-taker.git

Across the top of the page, click on the Fork button on the right.

Once you have done this, you will see the repo copied within your Github account

Click the Green "Code" Button, and copy repo link. 

Open Terminal and run "git clone (Paste Link Here)"

Once repo has been cloned, you can run ` code .` to open in Visual Studio Code. 

From there, open your terminal inside VS Code by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + `. 

Next, type "npm install" to install dependencies.

Once you have done this, type "node server.js" to run the program locally. 

Then the user can see the program run locally by navigating to https://localhost:8080. 

Once the user is finished they can shut down the server by typing `Ctrl + C`. 

Alternatively you can check out the app at https://sheltered-scrubland-15458.herokuapp.com/
